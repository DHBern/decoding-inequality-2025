## Leseauftrag "All Data Are Local"

### **"All Data Are Local" – A Critical Review**

#### **Introduction: Why Data Are Never Neutral**  

In *All Data Are Local*, Yanni Alexander Loukissas challenges the common belief that data are **neutral, universal, and objective**. He argues that data are **deeply embedded in local, historical, and institutional conditions**, making it impossible to separate them from their context. Instead of treating **data sets** as isolated and self-contained, he urges readers to examine **data settings**—the environments in which data are produced, organized, and used.

---

#### **📌 Key Themes & Arguments**

##### **1. The Locality of Data: Four Case Studies**
Loukissas introduces four examples to illustrate how data are shaped by their origins:

- **Harvard’s Arnold Arboretum:** A data record for a cherry tree mistakenly attributes its collection to a botanist who had died years earlier, highlighting inconsistencies in institutional data.
- **Digital Public Library of America (DPLA):** Different institutions contribute metadata in varying formats, causing classification inconsistencies.
- **NewsScape (TV News Archive):** Data are inseparable from the **algorithms that process them**, shaping what information is surfaced or obscured.
- **Zillow (Real Estate Data):** Zillow provides transparency in the housing market, yet **masks structural inequalities**.

##### **2. The Problem with Data as "Sets"**
- The term *data set* implies that data are **complete, standardized, and universally applicable**, which is misleading.  
- Instead, **data settings** acknowledge the **social, institutional, and technological environments** that shape data collection and interpretation.  
- Understanding the **context of data creation** is essential to prevent misinterpretation.

##### **3. The Rise of Data Skepticism**
- In the early 2010s, skepticism toward **data neutrality** increased, with concerns about:
  - **Algorithmic bias** (e.g., Google’s search algorithms reinforcing stereotypes).
  - **Misinformation & manipulation** (e.g., the role of fake news in the 2016 U.S. election).
  - **P-Hacking in academic research**, where scientists manipulate statistical analyses for misleadingly significant results.

##### **4. From Data Collection to Critical Data Practices**
- Identifying bias isn’t enough—we must **change how we engage with data**.
- Recognizing **locality in data** allows for **mitigation of biases, context-aware findings, and ethical use**.
- Loukissas advocates for a **reflexive, comparative, and critical approach** to data work.

##### **5. Case Studies as a Framework for Critical Thinking**
Each chapter explores **six core principles** through real-world examples:
- Data are **attached to places** (**Arnold Arboretum**).
- Data come from **heterogeneous sources** (**DPLA**).
- Data and **algorithms are intertwined** (**NewsScape**).
- **Interfaces shape data perception** (**Zillow**).
- Later chapters offer **practical guidelines for ethical data use**.

##### **6. Resisting Digital Universalism**
- The **myth of digital universalism** assumes that technology transcends place and context.
- This belief, rooted in **Silicon Valley ideology**, ignores **the cultural, economic, and political power structures** embedded in data systems.
- Loukissas calls for **resisting universalism** by **acknowledging the locality of data**, ensuring it remains **accountable to its origins and impacts**.

---

#### **🗂 Summary of Chapter 3: "Collecting Infrastructures"**
##### **How Data Infrastructures Shape Knowledge**
This chapter explores **data infrastructures**, particularly the **DPLA**, and questions whether data can truly be separated from their **local origins**.

##### **📌 Key Insights:**
- **Data Standardization vs. Context Loss:**  
  - The DPLA standardizes data across institutions, but this often **erases unique local contexts**.
  - Its **MAP (Metadata Application Profile)** forces diverse data sources into a rigid structure.

- **The Role of Locality in Data:**  
  - Institutions classify data differently (e.g., the term *Upstate* means different things in different regions).
  - **Historical bias**: Some institutions categorize race inconsistently or exclude certain demographics.

- **Data Visualization as a Critical Tool:**  
  - The **Library Observatory** uses a tree-map visualization to show **how different institutions contribute to the DPLA**.
  - The **Temporalities Project** highlights inconsistencies in **date formatting** across data sources.

- **The Influence of Vannevar Bush’s Memex:**  
  - Bush’s 1945 vision of a **universal digital archive** influences modern data infrastructures.
  - Loukissas critiques this ambition, arguing that **knowledge cannot be divorced from its social and institutional context**.

- **The Political & Ethical Stakes of Data Infrastructures:**  
  - Large, well-funded institutions like **Smithsonian or Getty** dominate data collection, reinforcing **power imbalances**.
  - Loukissas calls for **counterdata infrastructures** that challenge dominant narratives and promote **inclusive histories**.

#### **🗂 Summary of Chapter 7: "Beyond Data Sets"**
##### **Why Open Data Isn’t Enough**
Loukissas argues that **data accessibility does not guarantee understanding**. Instead of simply providing **open data**, we need **contextualized guides** that explain their origins and limitations.

##### **📌 Rethinking the Goals of Data Work**
Loukissas contrasts **traditional data objectives** with **alternative, locally grounded goals**:

| **Traditional Goals** | **Local Alternatives** | **Explanation** |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Orientation** | **Place-Making** | Data should not just help users navigate but also reveal the institutions behind them (e.g., Arnold Arboretum). |
| **Access** | **Restraint** | Open data can be misleading if context is missing (e.g., misinterpretations of the 2016 U.S. election polls). |
| **Analysis** | **Reflexivity** | Algorithms are **not neutral**—we must critically engage with them (e.g., Google’s biased autocomplete). |
| **Optimization** | **Contestation** | Data-driven decisions often ignore competing interests (e.g., Zillow optimizing the housing market while hiding its inequalities). |

---

##### **📌 A Five-Step Approach to Critical Data Practices**
Loukissas proposes a **methodology for engaging with data critically**:

1. **Read:** Examine the dataset for inconsistencies or unusual features.  
2. **Inquire:** Consult **experts, data collectors, or subjects** to understand the dataset’s background.  
3. **Represent:** Use **visualizations** to highlight patterns and biases.  
4. **Unfold:** Investigate **how data are collected, processed, and normalized**.  
5. **Contextualize:** Analyze **who uses the data and what ethical concerns arise**.

This approach treats **data as an ethnographic inquiry**, emphasizing **critical engagement rather than passive consumption**.

---

#### **🔍 Conclusion: Data as a Social & Ethical Responsibility**
Loukissas closes with a **call to action**: **we must change how we engage with data**. Instead of treating data as **abstract, portable facts**, we should see them as **points of contact between people, institutions, and power structures**.

He warns against **digital universalism**, arguing that data should be **understood within their specific historical, institutional, and social contexts**. Instead of prioritizing **optimization and efficiency**, we should focus on **social justice, accountability, and transparency**.

---

#### **💡 Final Takeaway**
> **"Do not mistake the availability of data as permission to remain at a distance."**  

Loukissas urges us to **engage with data deeply, ethically, and contextually**—not just as raw information but as a **socially embedded artifact** requiring care and responsibility.

---

#### **💬 Discussion Questions**
- How do **data infrastructures** reinforce **social inequalities**?  
- What would **ethical open-data policies** look like in practice?  
- Is it possible to create **truly neutral datasets**, or is all data inherently biased?
